# CordCrafter is an advanced, multi-use bot run on Python.
> [!NOTE]
This repo was made for Issue Trackers, and sharing the official release builds in separate folders, but as of 1.6.0, a `dev` package can now also be found in the root directory of the repo!  
Said `dev` package is included in `CordCrafter Releases/...` as the patch number instead.  
For any suggestions feel free to create a GitHub Issue.

Some aspects of this repo and bot have different LICENSE's bound to them, before forking, downloading or using anything, please review them.  
Generally everything is licensed under MIT, though, unless explicitly stated otherwise.

Having a strong understanding of the discord.py API wrapper and python in general is suggested to understand most, even basic parts of the code, but it's not 100% impossible.
