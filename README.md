# CordCrafter is an advanced, multi-use bot run on Python.
> [!NOTE]
This repo was made for Issue Trackers, and sharing the official release builds in separate folders, but as of 1.6.0, a `dev` package can now also be found in the root directory of the repo!  
Said `dev` package is included in `CordCrafter Releases/...` as the patch number instead.  
For any suggestions feel free to create a GitHub Issue.
